<h2>What is Supreme Life?</h2>
<p>For your whole life, you are constrained by parents' high expectations, social requirements and ethical rules. You have to be a good student, a polite young man and a compliant employee to survive in this society. You are getting tired of this kind of normal life. Why not get together with some friends soon and say NO! Say no to racists, to sexist pigs, to authority figures, to religion; say no to television, patriotism, political ideologies, any of the thousand and one ways in which this society keeps you from realizing your own needs and desires. You'll find the more you do it, the more you'll like it!</p>
<p class="fuck">JUST SAY "FUCK OFF." YOU'LL GET A LOT OF SATISFACTION.</p>
<h2>What you truly desire?</h2>
<p>You want a pair of Yeezy 750 Boost, an Off-White wool jacket and a Vetements coat, but they are too expensive for you to afford. Then you become a hater, begin leaving acerbic comments on their social media saying how ugly these things are and refusing to admit how badly you want them. Why not be honest to yourself once? You want to live a lifestyle just like Kendall Jenner, Kanye West and other celebrities, or you won't even pay any attention to them.</p>
<h2>What would you do?</h2>
<p>Imagine in the Supreme Life, you are able to get whatever you want. What would you do? Are you going to buy a luxurious sports car? Or are you going to date those beautiful girls in the night club that you dare not to enter? There does not exist a "true" answer to this question. The most important thing is to follow your heart, and do not wait until the moment that you regret your decisions. Jeremy has his decisions now, and I hope all of you guys can find yours one day.</p>
